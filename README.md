# Question-Decomposition-For-Numerical-Reasoning
This project explores question decomposition to improve numerical reasoning over hybrid text and multi-hierarchical tables. Built on the MultiHiertt/MT2NET pipeline, it decomposes multi-hop questions into simpler sub-questions to boost QA performance on complex financial and tabular data.
